In life, things are built gradually, and nothing emerges instantly. This photo, taken a few years ago, captures a crucial moment during a practical test of an innovative project I developed with Rodrigo Garces. We had the voluntary participation of Professor Ana Lucia Zandomeneghi, an experience that taught me the valuable art of learning to learn.

The project was an automatic attendance system that recorded students' presence when entering and leaving the classroom. I started working on it in my second semester of college, with little programming knowledge. But, with an immense desire to learn, I sought guidance from Professor Dr. Paulo Rog√©rio, who suggested this challenge to me.

At that time, I knew little beyond Python. HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, and C++ (used for the NodeMCU firmware) were all new to me. Despite this, I embraced the challenge, motivated by my determination to learn and grow.

The development involved several iterations of prototypes until we reached the model tested that day. The journey taught me that when I face an unknown challenge, I can turn to resources like Google (at that time, we didn't have ChatGPT yet) to learn and overcome it. This trial-and-error learning approach proved more valuable than any formal course, teaching me in practice.

Developing the ability to adapt and learn autonomously transformed my life. I always emphasize this when someone seeks knowledge from me in the field. It's essential to try solving problems on your own before seeking immediate help, thus developing agility and autonomy.

Teachers and tutors are important, of course, but their main role is to provide guidance. The pursuit of knowledge is a personal journey. I hope my experience inspires you to understand that this ability to adapt and self-learn can be as transformative for you as it was for me.

From the moment I entered technology college, discovering the world of programming, until landing my first job in the field in 2019, technology has been a constant source of passion for me. The year 2020, with all its challenges brought by COVID-19, was a period of adaptation and growth. Now, in 2023, I see my life in a completely new way. Although I'm just at the beginning of my career, I'm excited about the bright future that awaits me. It hasn't been an easy path, but I'm learning to value every step of the process.

Technology has opened countless doors for me, providing the chance to meet incredible people, work on projects that push my limits, and make a positive impact on society. It has shaped my professional and personal growth, teaching me to be curious, creative, and resilient. It has shown me that there are no barriers to what we can achieve with passion and dedication.

I understand that technology may not be for everyone, but I firmly believe it's within reach of anyone willing to dedicate themselves and commit. Your background, your past, or your dreams are not barriers. Technology is a powerful tool for transformation and innovation. It all starts with a courageous step to dive into this fascinating world.

I hope my story inspires those who are considering a career in technology or who need a push to persist on this path. Technology is a vast and ever-evolving field, with room for a variety of profiles and skills. What matters is the desire to learn, challenge yourself, and above all, have fun in the process.

I am deeply grateful for everything technology has brought me and eager to discover what the future holds.
